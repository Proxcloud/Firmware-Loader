# java-binutils

A small utility library that can read various binary format files, like AR, ELF, COFF, Intel-Hex and Motorola S-record (srec) files.

Note that the original implementation of the various readers were modified versions of code found in the Eclipse project. As from
2016, the implementations were rewritten from scratch and as such open sourced under another license.
